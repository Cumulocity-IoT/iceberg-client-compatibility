# Iceberg client compatibility

Which Apache Iceberg clients can read a lake that Cumulocity Streaming Lake Ingestion writes, and how to
connect each of them.

The table below is generated from test runs against a Cumulocity tenant. Each run connects the way a customer
does: through the tenant's Iceberg catalog, with a read-only catalog principal and storage credentials that the
catalog vends. The tests only read; Streaming Lake Ingestion is a managed lake.

## Compatibility

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED TABLE -->

<!-- END GENERATED TABLE -->

✅ works · ⚠️ works with a workaround, see the footnote · ❌ fails · ➖ not supported by the client ·
❔ inconclusive · empty: not tested.

The latest version of each client is re-tested every week. Older versions keep their last result and its date,
and are not re-tested.

## Connecting a client

Each folder in [`clients/`](clients) holds an example for that client. The tests run the same connection code, so
an example that is listed as working has worked in the last run. Every client uses the same catalog settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Catalog type | Iceberg REST |
| URI | `https://iceberg.<environment-domain>/api/catalog` |
| Warehouse | `<your-tenant-id>` |
| Credential | `<clientId>:<clientSecret>`, issued with the principals API of your tenant |
| OAuth2 token endpoint | `https://iceberg.<environment-domain>/api/catalog/v1/oauth/tokens` |
| Scope | `PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL` |
| Header `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` | `vended-credentials` |

## Running the tests

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in; `.env` is ignored by git. The harness needs Python 3.11 or later.

```shell
python -m unittest harness.test_harness   # self-test of the harness
python -m harness.render                  # regenerate the table from results/
```
